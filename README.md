<h1 align="center">42_libft</h1>  

My first project at 42 SÃ£o Paulo, where i need to develop some functions that is standards in C language for help me in future projects.  
This project was made according to [Norm](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/960/norme.en.pdf)

This project in general was easy, so the struggling here was avoid memory leaks (all funcions are tested with valgrind)
